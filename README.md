This program is intended to provide the user with a safer version of his/her C program. The user can input a .c text file and the SaferC program will scan through 
the contents of the file. It is intended to provide checks that a normal compiler will not provide. These include array bounds checking, variable declaration checks,
and some other logical expression checks. The SaferC program will also generate code in certain situations to save the programmer the work of troubleshooting their
code in certain situations. 

usage
run safeC like any other script in the shell. exampel below
./safeC < test1.c
